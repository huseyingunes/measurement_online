<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Abstract

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology which encompasses devices, software and access services that enable us to
control, track and analyze physical variables in our environment. IoT application areas include activities such as vehicle,
home, human and pet monitoring and control, agricultural automation, energy consumption, security and supervision,
building management, smart homes and cities, Machine to Machine (M2M) and wireless sensor networks, RFID (Radio
Frequency Identification) systems and remote medical health services. M2M forms the basis for the IoT concept. M2M
technology involves machines communicating with each other without the need for human intervention. In this technology,
information about objects is provided using sensing methods such as RFID, Near Field Communication (NFC) and sensors,
as well as wireless communication techniques such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared, etc. M2M applications
help monitor and analyze physical quantities such as temperature, pressure, magnetic field, electric field, humidity, light
intensity, ultrasound, flow rate, acceleration, etc. through smart sensors in order to obtain decision information. A smart
sensor structure includes a sensitive element, a signal processing circuit, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a Micro
Controller Unit (MCU) and a Network interface. In this study, a measurement system has been developed, which is
compatible with all sensor types, uses a smart sensor structure and works on a 5D scanner system that provides analog or
digital output. The software of this system, which is an M2M application, has been developed with Node.JS, an open-source,
server-side application generally used in networked applications. Thanks to the software developed, wired and wireless
communication was established with the sensors on the 5D scanner, location information and sensor data were collected via
Arduino Mega 2560 and Raspberry Pi, saved to the Firebase cloud database and plotted in real time. Full details of the
operation of the developed measurement system are described in the paper.
